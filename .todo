☐ When populates candle into empty database occurs Duplicate Key error
☐ Indicator should have a CandleProvider instead Candles parameter, and CandleSelection
☐ Create migration for sqlx
☐ Indicator process only last period candles, but on plotting need process all
☐ Remove annotations and url, move to google doc
☐ Remove .env and docker pass using bfg 
☐ Create docker compose
☐ Became public project
☐ Add new candle to indicators (or replace last)
☐ TopBottom is not a indicator, what is TopBottom? Maybe rename Indicator to IndicatorSerie and Indicator be a Trait
☐ Indicator provider, from hash map x enum
☐ Strategy (trade, position, rule, etc)
☐ Migrate TradeBase and TradeMacd
☐ Use close time or open time ? ema / mcad must use same
☐ See video Heikin Aishi
☐ More days to split column
☐ Candle width dynamic with selection
☐ Reduce plot dependency wasm x servo | slow time compilation
☐ Plot macd inds from selected
☐ Black theme (white grid lines)
☐ Download tickets/trade
☐ Live download tickets/trade
☐ Resolve confusion checker x synchronizer
☐ Apply candles selection in all commands
☐ Delete last candle from repo before reinsert
☐ Gui interface
☐ Create load command (load from database without read from expo) ?
☐ Not working minutes 60 from Exchange, fn for h, m, d
☐ Add RSI tac and plot
